### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Amir, Research Assistant at the university of Quebec.
In collaboration with the University of Quebec and the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden (KTH), I'm comparing Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms for the Heating and Cooling Load of a sample building. 
Blackbox and Whitebox models can be combined to solve many Heating and Cooling problems of buildings and districts.
Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ML and DL Algorithms for Building energy management systems
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Image processing using DL
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the project of energy management data analysis for Residential buildings
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about DL,ML, Energy management and Photography

- âš¡ Fun fact: I Love Night Sky Photography
