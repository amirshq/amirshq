### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Research Assistant at Ã‰cole de technologie supÃ©rieure (Ã‰TS) in MontrÃ©al, specializing in Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Data Science. My GitHub profile features a variety of projects across NLP, Computer Vision, and ML, reflecting my wide-ranging expertise and contributions to these areas.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ML and DL Algorithms for Building energy management systems
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Image processing using DL
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the project of energy management data analysis for Residential buildings
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about DL,ML, Energy management and Photography

With the aid of machine learning and deep learning, authorities will be able to predict the Energy Audits and Energy Demands in their districts and cities, and they will be able to meet the demand and supply. The DL algorithms, such as Artificial Neural Networks, are capable of training models for specific areas in large cities and eventually finding suitable models for a particular area. It is one of the best ways to meet future demand in cities due to rapid urbanization and high energy demand.
