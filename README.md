### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Amir, Research Assistant at Ã‰cole de technologie supÃ©rieure | Ã‰TS MontrÃ©al.
In collaboration with the Ã‰TS and the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden (KTH), I'm comparing Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms for the Heating and Cooling Load of a sample building. 
Blackbox and Whitebox models can be combined to solve many Heating and Cooling problems of buildings and districts.
Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ML and DL Algorithms for Building energy management systems
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Image processing using DL
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the project of energy management data analysis for Residential buildings
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about DL,ML, Energy management and Photography
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: amir.shahcheraghian@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I Love Night Sky Photography

With the aid of machine learning and deep learning, authorities will be able to predict the Energy Audits and Energy Demands in their districts and cities, and they will be able to meet the demand and supply. The DL algorithms, such as Artificial Neural Networks, are capable of training models for specific areas in large cities and eventually finding suitable models for a particular area. It is one of the best ways to meet future demand in cities due to rapid urbanization and high energy demand.
